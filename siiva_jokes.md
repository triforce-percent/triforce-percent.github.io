# Triforce% SiIvaGunner "Joke" Explanations

The “joke” for all the videos is that they are the soundtrack for Triforce% OoT ACE Showcase,
previously known as OoT Beta Showcase, performed at SGDQ 2022 by Sauraen, Savestate, and
dwangoAC. These are all custom music tracks arranged by Sauraen and 
[RebeccaETripp](https://www.youtube.com/rebeccaetripp) and
injected into an unmodified copy of Ocarina of Time live using ACE (controller input),
alongside other custom game content.

The recordings submitted here are captured from an unmodified copy of OoT running on a
real N64—the ACE setup was performed by Savestate and the sequences were injected by TASBot.
A “sound test” interface using controller button combos was also programmed and injected,
to allow for recording these tracks without any sound effects. So, unlike pretty much every
other SiIvaGunner upload, these are ACTUALLY high quality rips of music from the original,
unmodified game!

Joke: Arrangement by Sauraen primarily of Staff Roll 2 from Ocarina of Time 3D
on the 3DS, with a beginning based on the arrangement of Link’s theme from Age
of Calamity, and a changed ending. Mahito Yokota is the arranger of the 3DS
version itself. The underlying OoT3D -> OoT arrangement is “Staff Roll 2 -
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time” on SiIvaGunner, also arranged by Sauraen,
published May 2017. This version has substantial changes compared to that one.
